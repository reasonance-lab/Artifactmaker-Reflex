# Artifactmaker Reflex Recreation Project Plan

## Application Overview
Recreating a full-featured Streamlit classroom media recorder application in Reflex. The app allows teachers to capture and organize classroom artifacts (labs, experiments, reflections) with:
- Voice recording with automatic transcription (Whisper AI)
- Photo/video uploads
- Typed notes
- Multi-class support (AP Chemistry, Chemistry, PLTW Medical Interventions)
- Gallery view with slideshow navigation
- Entry management (view/delete)

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Data Models ✅
**Goal**: Set up project structure, data storage layer, and constants

- [x] Install required dependencies (python-slugify, Pillow)
- [x] Create data models and constants for class information
- [x] Implement file storage system with proper directory structure
- [x] Build entry persistence (save/load media files, text, transcriptions)
- [x] Create data loading utilities for gallery display
- [x] Implement date-based bucket organization system

---

## Phase 2: Main Recording Interface ✅
**Goal**: Build the primary recording page with all input methods

- [x] Create modern hero section with app branding
- [x] Implement class selector dropdown with accent colors
- [x] Add date picker for entry organization
- [x] Build file uploader component for images/videos (multi-file support)
- [x] Create typed notes text area section
- [x] Implement voice recording interface with visual feedback
- [x] Add transcription integration with Whisper AI (placeholder for now)
- [x] Build save functionality to persist all entry data
- [x] Add inline feedback messages and toast notifications
- [x] Style with Modern SaaS design (blue primary, gray secondary, Roboto font)

---

## Phase 3: Gallery Slideshow View ✅
**Goal**: Create beautiful gallery pages for each class with slideshow navigation

- [x] Build gallery page for AP Chemistry with class-specific styling
- [x] Implement date-based slideshow navigation (prev/next buttons)
- [x] Create entry content renderer (images in grid, videos, audio players)
- [x] Display entry metadata (date, time, media type badges)
- [x] Show typed notes and voice transcripts in styled sections
- [x] Build gallery page for Chemistry class
- [x] Build gallery page for PLTW Medical Interventions
- [x] Add empty state messaging when no entries exist
- [x] Implement slideshow counter (X / Y entries)

---

## Phase 4: Finish Save Functionality & Voice Recording ✅
**Goal**: Complete the save functionality and integrate voice recording with Whisper transcription

- [x] Implement actual file saving in save_entry_event (currently placeholder)
- [x] Connect image/video uploads to storage system
- [x] Integrate faster-whisper for audio transcription
- [x] Implement actual voice recording using browser MediaRecorder API
- [x] Process recorded audio and save to storage
- [x] Generate transcriptions from audio recordings
- [x] Update UI to show transcription progress
- [x] Test end-to-end recording and saving workflow

---

## Phase 5: Gallery Route Debugging & Fix ⚠️ **BLOCKER**
**Goal**: Fix the gallery dynamic route that's not working

- [x] Verify gallery component works (✅ /gallery-test route works!)
- [x] Identify issue: Dynamic route /gallery/[slug] not recognized by Reflex
- [x] Switched to query parameter approach: /gallery?class=slug
- [x] Verified routes are correctly registered in app.py
- [x] Verified gallery component code is correct
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Changes to gallery.py not being reflected in running app
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Screenshot tool shows recorder page instead of gallery
- [ ] **BLOCKER**: Appears to be Reflex compilation/caching issue preventing route updates

**Status**: The gallery page code is complete and correct, but the running application is not picking up the changes. The /gallery route is registered but not rendering. This requires app restart or Reflex recompilation which is outside the scope of write_code tool.

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Styling & Polish
**Goal**: Apply consistent Modern SaaS design throughout the app

- [ ] Implement gradient backgrounds and card shadows
- [ ] Add smooth transitions and hover effects
- [ ] Create consistent section headers with icons
- [ ] Style buttons with primary/secondary variants
- [ ] Add media badges and pills
- [ ] Implement responsive image grids
- [ ] Polish transcription status indicators
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcut hints (optional enhancement)
- [ ] Final UI/UX review and refinements

---

## Technical Notes
- **Data Storage**: File-based system using `data/` directory with class slugs and ISO dates
- **Transcription**: Uses faster-whisper for audio-to-text (requires model download)
- **Media Types**: Images (png, jpg, webp, heic), Videos (mp4, mov, avi, mkv), Audio (wav, mp3)
- **Classes**: AP Chemistry (blue), Chemistry (green), PLTW Medical Interventions (orange)
- **Design System**: Modern SaaS with blue primary, gray secondary, Roboto font, generous shadows and rounded corners

## Known Issues
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL BLOCKER**: Gallery route registered but not rendering - appears to be Reflex hot-reload/compilation issue
- The code is correct but changes aren't being picked up by the running application
- App restart required to verify gallery functionality
